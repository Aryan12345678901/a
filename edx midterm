Problem 3
10/10 points (graded)
Answer the following question without running the code. The procedure isMyNumber is used to hide a secret number (integer). It takes an integer x as a parameter and compares it to the secret number. It returns:

-1 if the parameter x is less than the secret number

0 if the parameter x is correct

1 if the parameter x is greater than the secret number

The following procedure, jumpAndBackPedal, attempts to guess a secret number. The only way it can interact with the secret number is through the isMyNumber procedure explained above.

def jumpAndBackpedal(isMyNumber):
    '''
    isMyNumber: Procedure that hides a secret number. 
     It takes as a parameter one number and returns:
     *  -1 if the number is less than the secret number
     *  0 if the number is equal to the secret number
     *  1 if the number is greater than the secret number
 
    returns: integer, the secret number
    ''' 
    guess = 1
    if isMyNumber(guess) == 1:
        return guess
    foundNumber = False
    while not foundNumber:
        sign = isMyNumber(guess)
        if sign == -1:
            guess *= 2
        else:
            guess -= 1
    return guess
Unfortunately, the implementation given does not correctly return the secret number. Please fix the errors in the code such that jumpAndBackpedal correctly returns the secret number.
